TODO:
 - Repair toasts
 - Upload modpack.zip to google drive automatically
 - Disable all other mods on client (config feature)
 - Make AutoModpack more secure 
   for example:   
      Plan A (client side)
      1. Search mods on trusted sites like modrinth/curseforge
      2. Compare them size (and maybe something more)
      3. If size is correct, procced 

      Plan B (server & client side)
      1. Search mods on trusted sites like modrinth/curseforge (server side)
      2. Send slugs/id's from trusted sites to client (server side)
      3. Auto-download all these mods from trusted sites (client side) 

     + add some hash checks
 - Modpacks menu (dev branch)
 - PackWiz compatibility
 - Improve the optional modpack feature (The server can set requirement level of some mods like a resource pack: Optional or Required)
 
 - Fix every issue from the issue tracker



Thanks for all contributions! :)
